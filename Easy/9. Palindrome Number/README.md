# Palindrome Number Checker
This code is a solution to the problem of determining whether a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Contents
The code consists of a single class, Solution, which contains a single method, isPalindrome.
This method takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input is a palindrome.

The isPalindrome method first converts the input integer to a string using a stringstream.
A stringstream is a stream class that allows you to read and write string data as if it were a stream of characters.
This is useful for converting data types, such as integers, to and from strings.

Next, the method loops through the characters in the string, comparing the characters at the beginning and end of the string.
If any of the characters do not match, the method returns false to indicate that the input integer is not a palindrome.
If all of the characters match, the method returns true to indicate that the input integer is a palindrome.

## Requirements
The code is written in C++ and has no external dependencies. It should be compatible with any C++ compiler.
