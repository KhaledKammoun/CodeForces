# Two Sum
This code is a solution to the problem of finding two elements in an array that sum to a specific target value.

## Contents
This method takes a vector of integers (nums) and an integer target value as input, and returns a vector of integers containing the indices of the two elements in the nums array that sum to the target value.

The twoSum method first determines the length of the nums array. It then iterates through the array, using two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the array.
If the sum of two elements is equal to the target value, the method returns a vector containing the indices of those elements.
If no such elements are found, the method returns a vector containing two zeros.

## Requirements
The code is written in C++ and has no external dependencies. It should be compatible with any C++ compiler.
